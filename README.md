# Feature overview
A vehicles company have a number of connected vehicles that belongs to a number of customers.
They have a need to be able to view the status of the connection among these vehicles on a monitoring display.

The vehicles send the status of the connection one time per minute; no request from the vehicle means no connection.

The company would like to create a data store that keeps these vehicles with their status and the customers who own them, as well as a GUI (preferably web-based) that displays the status.
